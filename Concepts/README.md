# Concepts

This folder contains fundamental concepts of image processing and deep learning.  
Each subfolder provides explanations, visual examples, and in some cases, simple implementations to build intuition before working on projects.


## Convolution

This section contains resources to understand 1D and 2D convolution, both in theory and visual form.
