# Image Processing in C/C++/Python

This repository contains a collection of projects and experiments in Image Processing and Computer Vision, implemented using OpenCV (C++/Python) and also custom implementations without OpenCV in C.  

It covers concepts such as edge detection, denoising, CNN architectures, pooling, upscaling, masking, and object detection.  

## Structure

- **Cnn_Architecture/**: CNN building blocks.  
- **Concepts/** → Small examples to learn fundamental concepts.  
- **Data/** → Images used for testing.  
- **Denoise/** → Image denoising techniques.  
- **Edges/** → Edge detection algorithms.  
- **Mask/** → Image masking and region selection.  
- **Non-OpenCv/** → Implementations of algorithms without OpenCV using C.  
- **ObjectDT/** → Object detection examples.  
- **Pooling/** → Pooling operations.
- **Upscaling/** → Image upscaling experiments. 
- **Projects/** → Larger integrated projects combining multiple techniques.  

Note: All examples have been tested on Linux.
