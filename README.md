# Image Processing in C/C++/Python

This repository contains a collection of projects and experiments in Image Processing and Computer Vision, implemented using OpenCV (C++/Python) and also custom implementations without OpenCV in C.  

It covers concepts such as edge detection, denoising, CNN architectures, pooling, upscaling, masking, and object detection.
