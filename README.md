# Image Processing in C++

This project demonstrates basic image processing techniques using OpenCV in C++. It includes edge detection, noise reduction, and contour detection.

Use the following command to compile the code:

```bash
g++ canny.cpp -o cany `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`
```
Run:

```bash
./cany ../image.jpg
```
Note: This has been tested on Linux (Linux Mint XFACE)
