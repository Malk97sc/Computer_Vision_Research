# Contours

This folder contains an implementation of contour detection using the **Moore-Neighbor Tracing Algorithm**. The goal is to trace the boundary of connected white regions (value `255`) in a binary image.

## Moore-Neighbor Tracing Algorithm

The algorithm is a contour-following method that iteratively checks the 8-connected neighborhood of a pixel to trace an objectâ€™s boundary.

## Implementation

The core implementation is provided in the `FindContour` class, which includes:

- **`find_start()`**: Finds the first white pixel (255) in the binary image, marking the starting point of the contour.  
- **`search_contour()`**: Applies the Moore-Neighbor tracing algorithm to follow the contour until it returns to the starting point.  
- **`contour2CV()`**: Converts the custom contour representation into an OpenCV-compatible format for visualization.
